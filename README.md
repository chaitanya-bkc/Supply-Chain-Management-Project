Comparative Study of Forecasting Models

Forecasting is an important technique which is used almost everywhere now-a-days
Any Forecasting starts with insights derived from management's knowledge and
expertise. Organizations must understand the more complex elements of the various
forecasting methodologies in order to gain the most numerous benefits from forecasts.
Also, be aware of what an appropriate forecasting method type can and cannot achieve,
as well as which forecast type is most suited to a certain requirement. Forecasting helps
in improving asset utilization for the company thereby reducing the operating risk for the
company.It helps in creating new business strategies,improves management quality and
assists in making the finest management decisions possible.

I attempted to compare four forecasting models in this repository: Simple Regression, LSTM, Holt's Winter Exponential Smoothening, and Seasonal ARIMA.
